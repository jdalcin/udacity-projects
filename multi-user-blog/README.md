								Multi-User Blog

Function:

A blog for multiple users. Once an account is registered, users can post and comment. 

Steps:

1. Reach the front page by either going to the URL or through your own localhost server using the file "main.py" in Google App Engine. 
   If you use your own server, then make sure the location of the files within the "main.py" directory are unaltered.
2. register or log into the blog.
3. update the blog with posts and comments.
4. logout when finished.

Notes:
* "main.py" can only be opened with Python 2.7
* the blog consists of one page that continually updates based off the posts of all users.
* users cannot have access to the blog until they register their accounts.
* users can only rate others' posts. 
* users can only edit/delete their own posts and comments.
* users can only register usernames that have yet to be taken.
